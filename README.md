i gave a typical website like look to the testing platform . this contains header footer and main content area .
the .jsx pages added are displayed in the main content area only . 
also implementing a protected routes .jsx just if someone need them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
to add a .jsx page in this existing website model 
you just have to go to root.jsx file and add the folder destination 
next create a root path for your page .
finally dont forget to correctly palce the page in pages folder along with the css file. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
i have included the not found page .jsx too so you will see a default page when no page at that destination is found . 

happy coding!!
